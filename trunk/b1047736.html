		<h4>Language use</h4>
		The language uses to create that game is Java, in particular the LWJGL
		library that allow OpenGL utilisation.
		<h4>Architecture</h4>
		The application is developp use the design Pattern <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern">"States"</a>. Here
		is the list of states :
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Menu : Displaying the Menu
			<li>HighScore : Displaying the highiest scores
			<li>Game : Running the game
			<li>Countdown : Countdown before the game starts
			<li>Restart : Create a new game
			<li>Perdu : Displaying the final score, save it.
		</ul>
		Each states will indicate to the controller (a Java Classe) the next
		state to launch.

		<h4>Seting up, launching and options</h4>
		To run the application, unzip Snake3D.zip and launch the link
		according to your operation System. You can modify the maze by editing
		the file ""maze.txt". Each line correspond at a wall position. Number
		must be between -100 and 100. (0,0) is the middle of the map. You can
		also have a look at "options.txt". Here you can set : the default
		number of apple on the field, and the two different snake speed. Just
		increase the speed to make it faster, decrease to make it slower. You
		can set the normal Speed, and the bullet-time speed.
		<h4>User Manual</h4>
		The application start with a menu. Three options are available :
		Start, which will launch the game
		<h5>Key shorcuts</h5>
		There are some keys that you can press during the execution. Here is a
		list of what they do :
		<ul class="list">
			<li><em>A</em> : These key enable and disable full screen for
				the application.
			<li><em>V</em> : These key allows, when a game is started, to
				switch bet ween two cameras : a fixed one, and another one following
				the snake.
			<li><em>R</em> : If a game is started, the press of this key
				will start a new game.
			<li><em>Escape</em> : If your the menu, it will quit the game.
				An other screen, it will bring you back to the menu.
			<li><em>B</em> : Bullet Time. The user have a limited number of
				Bullet-Time. Each time you press that Key, the game will slow down
				for some seconds. Quiet useful to go next to the wall !
		</ul>
		You can also try "U","I" and "O", and see what it does for the snake head.
		<h5>Items</h5>
		Here is a list of the item you'll find on the map
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Apples : Those are the classice Apples, it allows you to
				grow up and win some points !
			<li>Gold Apples : Those apples will appears less often on the
				field. They make you earn more points for a limited time.
			<li>Blue Apples : Those apples cut the snake tail, and remove
				half of it.
			<li>Walls : just an advice, don't it them.
			<li>Snake : This is the object you control. And a quick
				remberer, snakes don't do cannibalism.
